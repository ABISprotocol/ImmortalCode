The following concept takes into account initial PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technologies and techniques as originally refined and
broadly adopted in the late 1990s.  The PCR techniques below are summarized and do not constitute a complete procedure. 

I.  PCR

This involves three steps, which are:

- Denaturation, or heating of DNA.
- Annealing, or binding.
- Primer Extension 

As time went on, living things that were killed by this process in large numbers were replaced by beings that were or are more resistant to
heat. However, at all times, people have attempted to control what is happening in a laboratory environment at a genetic level and then modify the natural environment for their own purpose.  That is not the objective of this project, but the PCR technique comes into play here.

II.  Turritopsis dohrnii, Turritopsis Nutricula

A quick review of the literature finds that Turritopsis Nutricula jellyfish, a variety of which is now identified as Turritopsis dohrnii, has extraordinary long life due to its ability to convert into a polyp or polyps (and then create clones of itself from roots of that polyp), whenever it experiences extreme trauma.  In this interesting development, the T. Dohrnii [skip the stem cell step entirely](http://singularityhub.com/2011/04/25/immortal-jellyfish-provides-clues-for-regenerative-medicine/) and go from one form of the cell to another.  Researcher [Shin Kubota](http://www.seto.kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp/shinkubo/shinkubo_home/index_en.html), having done extensive work on the T. Dohrnii (example follows [here](http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf), provides some hope that this research may one day lead to 
therapeautic possibilities not previously contemplated.

III.  Coding the Turritopsis dohrnii

A [portion of the ribosomal RNA sequence of the Turritopsis dohrnii](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU272638.1) is shown below:

This is a preliminary analysis. However, if the Polymerase Chain Reaction could be accomplished as per step I and appropriate sequences
identified, specific genetic areas could then be clarified where additional material could be added - in essence, an [expanded genetic
code, as has been described in some studies](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/20/7566.abstract).  Additionally, given that gene synthesis and
cloning can be done by various companies within a week's time, it is entirely possible that the joining of natural genetic structures to a genetic structure designed on a computer screen can be done on a basis which would result in organisms (whether based in hardware or wetware) whose reproduction would be limited by temperature (in other words, the design could hard code maximum numbers or alternately limit the ability of such organisms to reproduce such that they would only be able to do so where they encounter intense heat such as in the proximity of deep sea thermals).  In this case, the genetic instruction already exists for self-healing in T. dohrnii, the question remains only as to how to address recursive speciation that would inevitably occur.

It is the vision of the author that perhaps the best path forward would be to model this as a method of transcendental communication,
where the resultant organisms, whether residing in hardware or wetware, would to the extent possible be released in order to 
develop communication and knowledge between species.   However, this would require additional design and more intentional many more levels
of intention of engagement with our natural and technical worlds, as well.  It is not an impossible goal, but it will require more work and 
participation that we currently are devoting as a global society.

Furthermore, though new technology empower individuals and associations, new modes of communication imply a network effect which transcends individual-to-individual mode of communication and thus requires that we reinspect the meaning of communication as we examine new developments
and interrelationships.  Communication will not be what we think it is, it is something that we will discover together.

IV.  Merging the Open Worm with Turritopsis dohrnii and Networking with Knowledge Nodes

It would be possible to merge the code from step III above of Turritopsis dohrnii into the (software) code of [Open Worm](https://github.com/ABISprotocol/OpenWorm). Although the Worm is intended as a model, it is possible that it could be launched to be run independently as a pilot to see how it functions on its own or in tandem with others.  In addition, it could be run with knowledge nodes that would enable it to share knowledge between species, particularly if the Worm is safely ensconced within an OpenROV in the ocean and is able to periodically return to land, and in this way enhance cross-species cooperation.  This initial pilot could lead to autonomous knowledge nodes that operate based on wave and solar power.
